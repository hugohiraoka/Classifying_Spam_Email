# Classifying Spam Email using BERT

Why do people send out spam email? Often, spam email is sent for commercial purposes. While some people view it as unethical, many businesses still use spam. 
The cost per email is incredibly low, and businesses can send out mass quantities consistently. Spam email can also be a malicious attempt to gain access to 
your computer.

Is spam email dangerous? Spam email can be dangerous. It can include malicious links that can infect your computer with malware. Do not click links in spam.
Dangerous spam emails often sound urgent, so you feel the need to act. Keep reading to learn about some of the basic spam types.

How do you deploy anti-spam tactics? Spam email can be difficult to stop, as it can be sent from botnets. Botnets are a network of previously infected computers.
As a result, the original spammer can be difficult to trace and stop.

If you receive a message that appears to be spam--for example, if you don’t recognize the sender--mark the message as spam in your email application.
Don't click any links or attached files, including opt-out or unsubscribe links. Spammers sometimes include these links to confirm that your email address
is legitimate, or the links may trigger malicious webpages or downloads.

Anti-spam solutions should address a wide range of known threats beyond spam, phishing and botnet attacks that include hard-to-detect short-lived and low 
volume email threats.

In this notebook, we develop a spam email classification model using TensorFlow.

# What is Bert?

BERT is a model for natural language processing developed by Google that learns bi-directional representations of text to significantly improve contextual understanding of unlabeled text across many different tasks.

It’s the basis for an entire family of BERT-like models such as RoBERTa, ALBERT, and DistilBERT.

BERT can be fine-tuned for many NLP tasks. It’s ideal for language understanding tasks like translation, Q&A, sentiment analysis, and sentence classification.
